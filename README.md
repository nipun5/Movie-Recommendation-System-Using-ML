## Installation
<br><br>
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine: 🚀🛠️🔧<br><br>


1.Clone the repository:<br><br>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Code1235/Machine-Learning-Projects
cd Movies-Recommendation-System
```

2.Ensure the following files are in your project directory:<br><br>

`movie_list_update.pkl`: Contains preprocessed movie data.<br><br>

`similarity.pkl`: Contains the precomputed similarity matrix.<br><br>

## How to Run<br><br>

Start the Streamlit web app:<br><br>

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
<br><br>
Open the provided local URL in your web browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).<br><br>

Use the dropdown to select a movie, then click on Show Recommendations to view the suggestions along with their posters. 🎬💻🌟<br><br>

## Functionality<br><br>

Core Function: `recommend`<br><br>

The recommendation system uses the following approach: 🧠🔍🎞️<br><br>

- Finds the index of the selected movie in the dataset.<br><br>

- Computes the cosine similarity with other movies.<br><br>

- Retrieves the top 7 similar movies and their poster links.<br><br>

### Example Output:

For the input movie "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1", the recommendations might include: 🌀🎥🎭<br><br>

- Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2<br><br>

- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban
<br><br>

- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
<br><br>

- Thor: Ragnarok	<br><br>

- Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone <br><br>

- The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring <br><br>

- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire <br><br>
